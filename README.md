# no-bs-cookie-consent-wordpress-plugin
This plugin is that: just a cookie consent popup with custom text, buttons and link to policy. No subscription no other things it wants you to have. Just the good old EU legal hell. It also actively deletes all cookies until you accept.

## How to install
Put the PHP file and CSS folder and its contents in a folder named "no_bs_cookie_consent" and copy that in the wp-content/plugins forlder on your server. Or zip it and upload it in WordPress's plugin manager. After this you have to activate it in the plugin page. The plugin will show up in the Settings menu.

## Warning
As this is a plugin I made for my own use I do not and can not garantee it will work for you. Feel free to tweak it.
